Quick Unwrapper v1.3 Known Issues

General:
	• Large meshes (high poly count) can cause the script to throw an error and/or crash.
	• Using the Automatic method on certain shapes, such as cylinders or spheres, will not unwrap the UVs properly as it won't know that the surface of the cylinder also needs to be cut.

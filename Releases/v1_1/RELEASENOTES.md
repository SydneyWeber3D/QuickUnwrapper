Quick Unwrapper v1.1 Release Notes

Additions:
	• Functional user interface.
	• Script functionality has been greatly expanded upon in order to provide better results.
	• User interface saves user settings after running the script.
	• User interface fetches user settings when opening the script in a new instance, even after closing Maya.
	• Script goes through different unwrapping processes using different options based on user settings.

Fixes:
	• Script should now properly soften/harden meshes after unwrapping them regardless of topology.
	• Shelf button should now be partially responsible, single click still does nothing but double click or [right-click > Settings] now opens the script's settings.
	• Script functionality has been broken down into smaller functions.
